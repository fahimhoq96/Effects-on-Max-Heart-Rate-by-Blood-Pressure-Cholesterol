# Linear Regression Model of Maximum Heart Rate with Blood Pressure and Cholesterol.

Cleveland dataset of 303 people was used to see if maximum heart rate is an association with resting blood pressure and if maximum heart rate has an association with serum cholesterol. Two different linear regression models was used to answer these questions. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle. The data was collected by Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The dataset has 14 variables. The response variable analyzed in this paper is the Maximum heart rate achieved. Sample size in the dataset is 303. Covariates of interest are Blood Pressure and Cholesterol. Other variables such as gender, age of patients, blood sugar, chest pain etc. were used as confounding and precision variables in the modeling.
